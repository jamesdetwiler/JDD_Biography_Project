        <h2>About Me</h2>    
        <p class="outset">I currently serve as a chaplain in the United States Air Force 
            and an Online Teaching Assistant for The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 
            I earned a B.S. in Political Science from the University of Kentucky, 
            a Master of Divinity from Gateway Seminary, 
            and a Ph.D. in Christian Preaching from The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary. 
            With over two decades of pastoral, teaching, and leadership experience, 
            I have served in a variety of cultural settings and ministry contexts. 
            My wife, Meredith, and I married in 2004. We met while serving 
            as short-term missionaries in Hawaii, China, and Thailand. In my spare time, 
            I enjoy pursuing my interests in music, sports, literature, and cooking.</p>
